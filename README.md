# Discrete Structures Notes 8
When moving ligation into the formula, reverse the sign inside
∀ -> ∃
∧ -> ∨
and so on

Proof is:
1. Formal argument
2. Every statement either is an axiom or is something that has been proof or is an assumption
3. Every step has to be correct
 
Note: 2k notates an even number, while 2k+1 notates an odd number
